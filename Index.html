 The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life.” <br>
 This are the BSIT students who presenting their capstone project at Computer laboratory of JHCSC.<br>
 And Now they are all  graduates last year 2020-2021.</p>

He work as Collector at Imperial Appliances plaza at Pagadian City.<br>
If future generations are to remember us more gratitude than sorrow, we must achieve  more than just  the miracles of technology. We must also leave them a glimpse  of the world as it was created,
  not just as it looked when we got through with it. The technology you use impresses no one.<br>
   The experience you create with it is everything.<br>
